Eight Years' War of Resistance started off as a mod that aims to slightly adjust the Asian Theater of World War II, but eventually grown into an overhaul mod that focus on the region of East Asia and South East Asia. This is a renewed release of the project. The mod aims to create an in-depth, historical, polished and fun experience for you to enjoy.

New historical nations are added in the Asia along with unique skins, events, focus trees, decisions, unique tech and dynamic news interface. Asian majors, namely China and Japan, have been reworked extensively. More extensive and historical focus trees are added along with new advisors, events, and decisions.
