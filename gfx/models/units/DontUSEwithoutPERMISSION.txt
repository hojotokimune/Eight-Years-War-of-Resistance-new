#I lost my home, businesses & family in an earthquake in New Zealand in 2011.  Runied my life.  I headed off around the world with what I had left to start a new life.  Got stranded in Lima, Peru.  Lost the last of my money here with extortion.  Please dont take my work without permisiion, it is how I pay for food.
